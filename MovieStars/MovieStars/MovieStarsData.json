(Dixon), a teacher and former actress, and Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, a barrister. She received a rigorous education at Ibstock Place School, a co-ed private school at Roehampton. However, young Emily Blunt had a stammer, since she was a kid of 8. Her mother took her to relaxation classes, which did not do anything. She reached a turning point at 12, when a teacher cleverly asked her to play a character with a different voice and said, I really believe in you. Blunt ended up using a northern accent, and it did the trick, her stammer disappeared.",
